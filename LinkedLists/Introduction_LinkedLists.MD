# Introduction To LinkedLists

Similar to Arrys, Linked List is a linear data structure. 
Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location.
The elements are linked using pointers.

## Why Linked List?
Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.
1. The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
2. Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.

## Advantages over arrays
1. Dynamic size
1. Ease of insertion/deletion

## Drawbacks:
1. Random access is not allowed. We have to access elements sequentially starting from the first node. So we cannot do binary search with linked lists efficiently with its default implementation. Read about it here.
1. Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
1. Not cache friendly. Since array elements are contiguous locations, there is locality of reference which is not there in case of linked lists.

## Representation:
A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.
Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:
1. data
1. Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node
In C, we can represent a node using structures. Below is an example of a linked list node with integer data.
In Java or C#, LinkedList can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class. The LinkedList class contains a reference of Node class type.

using namespace std;

class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

// This function prints contents of linked list
// starting from the given node
void printList(Node* n)
{
    while (n != NULL) {
        cout << n->data << " ";
        n = n->next;
    }
}

// Driver code
// Program to create a simple linked list with 3 nodes
int main()
{
    Node* head = NULL;
    Node* second = NULL;
    Node* third = NULL;

    // allocate 3 nodes in the heap
    head = new Node();
    second = new Node();
    third = new Node();

    /* Three blocks have been allocated dynamically.
    We have pointers to these three blocks as head,
    second and third

Data is random because we havenâ€™t assigned
anything yet */

    head->data = 1; // assign data in first node
    head->next = second; // Link first node with
    // the second node

    /* data has been assigned to the data part of first
    block (block pointed by the head). And next
    pointer of the first block points to second.
    So they both are linked.

*/

    // assign data to second node
    second->data = 2;

    // Link second node with the third node
    second->next = third;

    /* data has been assigned to the data part of the second
    block (block pointed by second). And next
    pointer of the second block points to the third
    block. So all three blocks are linked.

    head         second         third
        |             |             |

    third->data = 3; // assign data to third node
    third->next = NULL;

    /* data has been assigned to the data part of the third
    block (block pointed by third). And next pointer
    of the third block is made NULL to indicate
    that the linked list is terminated here.

    We have the linked list ready.

        head
            |

        +---+---+     +---+---+     +----+------+


    Note that only the head is sufficient to represent
    the whole list. We can traverse the complete
    list by following the next pointers. */
    printList(head);

    return 0;
